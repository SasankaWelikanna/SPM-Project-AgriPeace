# Software Test Automation Report

## 1. Manual Testing vs Automated Testing

### Manual Testing
Manual testing involves human testers executing test cases step by step without using any automation tools. The tester takes the role of an end-user and tests the application to identify any unexpected behavior or bugs.

**Advantages:**
- Flexibility in execution
- No initial automation setup cost
- Better for exploratory testing and user experience evaluation
- Easier to adapt to changing requirements
- Human intuition can catch visual and UX issues

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming and labor-intensive
- Prone to human error and inconsistency
- Difficult to scale for large applications
- Repetitive tasks are tedious and inefficient
- Limited coverage due to time constraints

### Automated Testing
Automated testing uses specialized tools and scripts to execute test cases automatically, compare actual outcomes with expected outcomes, and generate test reports.

**Advantages:**
- Faster execution and feedback
- Reusability of test scripts
- Consistency in test execution
- Better test coverage
- Efficient for regression testing
- Cost-effective in the long run

**Disadvantages:**
- High initial setup cost and learning curve
- Maintenance overhead as application evolves
- Limited ability to detect visual or UX issues
- Some scenarios are difficult to automate
- Tool dependencies and compatibility issues
